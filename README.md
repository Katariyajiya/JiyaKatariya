👋 About Me
I’m Jiya Katariya, a B.Tech 2nd-year student at CDGI with a strong passion for technology and programming. My journey in coding began with Java, which I later expanded to include Dart and Flutter for mobile app development. I am constantly learning and enhancing my skills, particularly in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), which I believe are the foundation of any good developer. Apart from my academics, I’m also active in extracurricular activities and currently serve as the GFG Campus Ambassador. I strive to contribute to the tech community, collaborate on exciting projects, and grow my expertise in emerging technologies.
